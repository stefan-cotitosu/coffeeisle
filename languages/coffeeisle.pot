#. Description of the plugin/theme
msgid ""
"CoffeeIsle is a classy WordPress theme for online shops and blogging. It "
"has a beautiful, unique interface providing a full-width parallax header, "
"oblique post shapes, and a slide-out menu. The store section follows the "
"same design lines, each product being displayed in a nice oblique form. The "
"theme was built with e-commerce (WooCommerce) in mind, that's why it comes "
"with an alternative shop page which you can use on your site in case you "
"like it better than the default template. As for the features, CoffeeIsle "
"is responsive, WPML ready, SEO friendly, and easy to customize. It also has "
"social icons, custom fonts, video post format, and multiple color schemes: "
"you can use 3 different colors at the same time to create beautiful "
"contrasts - background, post/product boxes, and the oblique line under each "
"entry in the shop and blog pages."
